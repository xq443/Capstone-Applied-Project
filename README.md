# Capstone-Applied-Project
The project's goal is to build a streaming data pipeline, that is, the data flow from the data ingestion, data transformation, to data application in the Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) system, which vital for the data analytics and decision making in the e-commerce business cases. 


In piloting the project, Mr. Yi, the senior software engineer from Alibaba Group, New York University sought to determine the effect of a combination of Apache engine systems on the nature of the raw data existing in the e-commerce real scenarios, 
presenting with the opportunity to lead the conversation on ways industries may seek to leverage this technology. 


The project entails four major Apache engines, namely Apache Canal, Kafka, Flink and Druid. 
Moreover, by developing selection criteria to help assess the functionality of several Apache streaming processing engines, 
research consists of identifying a proper streaming processing engine and a technical part of re-training the selected framework on a custom dataset.

Within the technical component, the project set out to investigate using Apache Flink as the core processing engine to conduct ETL process. 
The project team utilized Canal, a fine-tuned version engines developed by Alibaba, to monitor the incremental changes of the databases. 


In utilizing Flink, the project team had the opportunity to gain an in-depth understanding of the architecture and the Java code used to train the language model. 
The gathered outputs will allow the project sponsor to further explore the streaming pipeline's engine architecture and will serve as a reference for the project's testing. 

Recognize that technological advances within the Apache community, especially in real-time processing engines, have the potential to sustain and empower businesses for decades to come.
